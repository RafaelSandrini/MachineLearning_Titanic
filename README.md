Machine Learning for the Titanic survivors


This repository demonstrates using Visual Studio Code and Python with common data science libraries to explore a basic data science scenario. Specifically, using passenger data from the Titanic, you will learn how to set up a data science environment, import and clean data, create a machine learning model for predicting survival on the Titanic, and evaluate the accuracy of the generated model.

This is based on the following tutorial:
